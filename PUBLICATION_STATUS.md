## ⚠️ Publication Issues

### crates.io - Email Verification Required
**Status:** ❌ **Cannot publish yet**

**Error Message:**
```
the remote server responded with an error (status 400 Bad Request): 
A verified email address is required to publish crates to crates.io. 
Visit https://crates.io/settings/profile to set and verify your email address.
```

**Action Required:**
1. Visit https://crates.io/settings/profile
2. Add and verify email address: melvin.caradu@gmail.com (or admin@hfthot-lab.eu)
3. Re-run: `cargo publish`

**Package is ready:** All builds pass, just waiting for email verification.

---

### PyPI - Package Name Conflict
**Status:** ❌ **Cannot publish under "optimizr"**

**Issue:** Package name "optimizr" is already taken on PyPI (v1.4.7)
- URL: https://pypi.org/project/optimizr/
- Owner: Different maintainer
- Description: Different project (not our Rust library)

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR HTTPError: 403 Forbidden from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Option A: Use Different Package Name** (Recommended)
   - `optimizr-rs` - Rust variant naming
   - `optimizr-hft` - HFT-focused variant
   - `hfthot-optimizr` - Branded name
   - `rustimizr` - Play on "Rust optimization"
   
   **Steps:**
   ```bash
   # 1. Update pyproject.toml
   [project]
   name = "optimizr-rs"  # New name
   
   # 2. Rebuild wheel
   maturin build --release
   
   # 3. Upload to PyPI
   twine upload target/wheels/optimizr_rs-1.0.0-*.whl -u ThotDjehuty -p "..."
   ```

2. **Option B: Contact Current Owner**
   - Request name transfer
   - Package appears abandoned (last update unclear)
   - This could take weeks/months

**Recommendation:** Go with Option A (alternative name) to unblock release immediately.
